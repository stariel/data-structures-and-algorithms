**Linked Lists**

# Linked List Insertions 06
Write functions to insert new nodes at the end of a linked list or before or after a node with a given value.

## Challenge
Write functions to insert new nodes in a linked list as follows:
append(value) - write a function to add a new node with *value* to the last position in the list
insertBefore(value, newVal) - write a function to find the first node with *value* and insert a node with newVal directly before it
insertAfter(value, newVal) - write a function to find the first node with *value* and insert a node with newVal direclty after it
